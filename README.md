## Abstract

Human cognition is qualitatively unique among natural and artificial agents and primarily develops through learning. As a result, the best path toward general AI may be to reverse engineer human learning. One promising approach treats concepts as expressions in a mental programming language and learning as programmingâ€”developing and using programs in the language while also revising the language itself. We use psychological studies of humans to develop new techniques for automated program learning that we use in computational models guiding further psychological study. This virtuous cycle permits us to learn complex structures from limited data in an increasingly humanlike way.
